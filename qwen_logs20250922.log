Qwen Code Session Log - 2025年9月22日

Initial Setup:
- Working directory: /home/server/Docker/Task_feishu
- Project contains Docker setup with MySQL backend and frontend services

Database Connection Issues Investigation:
1. Found containers were restarting due to database connection errors
2. Logs showed "Access denied for user 'root'@'192.168.101.9' (using password: YES)"
3. Discovered MySQL was running on different server (192.168.101.13)

Network Testing:
- Confirmed connectivity to 192.168.101.13:3306 with telnet
- Verified MySQL was listening on the port

Database Configuration Fixes:
1. Created dedicated database user 'Task_user_mysql' with password '1qaz2wsx'
2. Updated docker-compose.mysql.yml to use new user credentials
3. Updated backend/mysql_db.py default configuration
4. Rebuilt and restarted Docker containers

Successful Connection Verification:
- Containers started running successfully
- API endpoint http://localhost:8000/api/tasks returned data
- Frontend accessible at http://localhost:8080

New User Creation Request:
- User requested creation of 'CRM_user_mysql' user
- Requested two tables: Task_Feishu_Table_records and Task_Feishu_Table_records_history
- Specific table structures defined with JSON data storage

Database Schema for New Tables:
1. Task_Feishu_Table_records (主记录表):
   - id: VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY
   - record_data: JSON
   - created_at: TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   - updated_at: TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

2. Task_Feishu_Table_records_history (记录版本历史表):
   - id: INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY
   - record_id: VARCHAR(255) 
   - record_data: JSON
   - version_tag: VARCHAR(50)
   - created_at: TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   - Indexes on record_id and version_tag

Connection Testing:
- Attempted to connect from 192.168.101.9 to 192.168.101.13 using CRM_user_mysql
- Initial connection failed with access denied error
- Determined need to create user on 192.168.101.13 server with proper host permissions

Recommended Solution:
1. SSH to 192.168.101.13 as dbserver
2. Connect to MySQL and create user with proper permissions:
   CREATE USER 'CRM_user_mysql'@'192.168.101.9' IDENTIFIED BY '1qaz2wsx';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON CRM_Feishu_DB.* TO 'CRM_user_mysql'@'192.168.101.9';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
3. Alternative wildcard approach if specific IP fails:
   CREATE USER 'CRM_user_mysql'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '1qaz2wsx';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON CRM_Feishu_DB.* TO 'CRM_user_mysql'@'%';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
